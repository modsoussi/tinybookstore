To compile the source files, simply run make. Classpath needs to indicate where the jar files needed are.
To run the Server, run java server port_num.
The name of the database is bookstore.db. If it doesn't exist, the program will create one and populate it.
Once the Server is running, it'll have an interactive terminal where if you type:
     - log : a log of all of the purchases that took place since the server was started are displayed.
     - restock time_interval amount : will start a thread that increments the stock of each book in the db 
       	       by amount every time_interval amount of time.
     - update item_num price : sets price of item_num to price.
